# TODO

* Better error handling
* Prometheus metrics / alerts when upgrade fails
* Improve node replacement logic
* Consider comparing node launch template AMI with latest launch template AMI
  instead of just comparing launch template versions to avoid node
  replacements when only userdata changes
* Find a way to trigger upgrades at a given time
